## Simple YouTubeConverter

This is a little fun project, because I don't like the YouTubeConverters out there.
This Converter is written in Python using [PyTube](https://pytube.io/en/latest/) for downloading and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
for converting the downloaded Videos. The GUI is made with [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
