## Simple YouTubeConverter

This is a little fun project, because I wanted to do my own simple YouTube Converter without ads.
This Converter is written in Python using [PyTube](https://pytube.io/en/latest/) for downloading and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
for converting the downloaded Videos. The GUI is made with [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Checkout the download section to find the latest release. You can download the program or a onefile version of it (plus the additional ffmpeg executable).
To use simply download, extract and put it in a directory of your choice. Each download contains a windows executable.
